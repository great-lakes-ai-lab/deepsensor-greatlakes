--- Checking for truly missing dates in GLSEA data from 2009-01-01 to 2022-12-31 ---
Total expected unique days in the full data range: 5113
Total actual unique days found in glsea_raw dataset: 10221

--- Result: Found 6 truly MISSING dates in GLSEA data! ---
These dates are expected in the range but are NOT present in glsea_raw:
  - 2012-08-21
  - 2012-08-22
  - 2021-07-31
  - 2021-08-31
  - 2021-09-30
  - 2021-10-31

This confirms that the `KeyError` is indeed due to actual data gaps for these specific dates.
The pre-filtering strategy in `gen_tasks` (to only use dates present in `glsea_raw`) is necessary to handle these gaps gracefully.
